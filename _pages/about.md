Hi there! I'm Kazimierz (often abbreviated to "Kaz"). I've made this website to serve as a portfolio hub; linking together all the things I am doing on a daily basis. This includes attending talks, coding projects and random, generally useful things that interest me. I made this wesbite using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) free hosting, and I used a template available [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
